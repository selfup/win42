# Win42

Find big files fast.

The answer to File Explorer taking too long is 42.

Find files over a gig and get easy to parse output:

```
win42 "C:\Users" 1000000000
```

Find files over a gig and write a json file in current directory called `win42.json`:

```
win42 "C:\Users" 1000000000 json
```
